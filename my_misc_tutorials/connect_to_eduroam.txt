The following method installs a gui to create the appropriate network profile (writing to a file 
somewhere) and then removes the gui.
Quickest Way:
    1) install frontend for NetworkManager (package network-manager-applet)
    2) run nm-connection-editor
    3) fill in the following:
             TAB            SETTING NAME                        VALUE
        - Wi-Fi             ssid                            =   "eduroam"
        - Wi-Fi Security    Security                        =   "WPA & WPA2 Enterprise"
        - Wi-Fi Security    Authentication                  =   "Protected EAP (PEAP)"
        - Wi-Fi Security    "No CA certificate is required" =   CHECKED
        - Wi-Fi Security    PEAP version                    =   Automatic
        - Wi-Fi Security    Inner Authentication            =   MSCHAPv2
        - Wi-Fi Security    Username                        =   "YOUR_USERNAME_HERE"
        - Wi-Fi Security    Password                        =   "YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE"
    4) remove network-manager-applet b/c gui is gross and I'm not a soy-dev (hahaha)

This method could be improved, but Oregon State Univeristy is stupid and does not have an install
script (see https://cat.eduroam.org/);  I've spent like 2 hours trying to get this to work without
using a gui, and I'm caving in.
