Added Fetch Installed Packages Script

Created a script that fetches the explicitly installed foreign and
non-foreign (includes yay pkgs) and stores this data in a list;  the
script filters against an ignore packages file.  

A pre-commit git hook was created in the git_hooks/
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch main
