# Make modifications to $PATH using this file.
# EXPLANATION: When some applications, like rofi, are launched by the window 
# manager instead rather than a terminal, $PATH is not updated from the bash
# files like .bashrc and .bash_profile. Furthermore the setting of $PATH 
# should not be tied to a specific shell type.
