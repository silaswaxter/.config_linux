= Are you trying to set a default layout that the display manager uses? 

**Stop.** Its not worth your time. See this 
https://askubuntu.com/questions/63681/how-can-i-make-xrandr-customization-permanent[discussion].

== Notes from my attempt
* Dont use Xorg multiheading as it leads to complications:
** At login manager, the configuration will load regardless of if there is an 
   HDMI1 connection
** Even though the eDP-1 display can be scaled using a matrix transformation, 
   the i3bar is not properly scaled.
